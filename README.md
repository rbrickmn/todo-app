This is a simple to-do list application!

# The process

This project is super simple and is very easy to complete/use! While I would work off his video, I decided that I also wanted an extra bit of functionality. So, I added the ability to listen for the Enter key when inside of the text box, allowing the user to quickly add tasks while never picking up the mouse!

# Future additions

- Responsive design for mobile use
- Dark mode toggle
